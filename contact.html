                    <div id="contact-two" class="text">The Street clan is a close knit family that enjoys spending as much time as we can with our friends and family. We were born and raised as Austinites and continue to enjoy the vast opportunities that Austin provides. We love rock climbing, biking, running, all the outdoor activities that the great state of Texas weather allows year round. There is a great Austin music scene, fantastic local cuisine to sophisticated restaurants, plus so many local artists that there is something fun and new to do everyday. 
                    <br><br>
                    With our entire family living in Austin, we needed a place where we could go to relax, enjoy each other's company, and have an incredible view, yet was close enough where we could all meet up within 20 minutes. We lucked out and found this gem. A custom built home by a professor at UT. It's various decks give multiple locations to get away from each other but still together in one house. This house is our home away from home and we hope you feel the same!
